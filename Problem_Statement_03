You are an owner of a restaurant and you would like to check orders being accepted and being
dispatched. You have asked a developer to design a system that processes orders one by one
and dispatches them in a sequence that the restaurant has received.
Developer must have to produce the following output:
Preparing Your Order - (Order_1)
Preparing Your Order - (Order_2)
Preparing Your Order - (Order_3)
The following orders have been dispatched.
Order_1
Order_2
Order_3
* You can add order name of your choice like (Palak Paneer, Dhokla etc )

Constraint: Developer has to choose a data type based on stack.
Store input in the form of list and pass it to the function get_order(order) you are allowed to use
the reverse method of list. Use of stack based methods are mandatory.
