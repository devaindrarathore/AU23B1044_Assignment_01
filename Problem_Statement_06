Problem Statement_06
The following computation is made to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) made on
digital products (Digital Merchandise, E-Commerce , Edtech products etc.)
Image Courtesy - Human Factors Internationals
Objective of this problem is to understand functional dependencies of ROI calculation made
towards UX projects in industry on various factors
like Total gain from improvements depends on Future Gain from Improvement etc.
Design and build solution to compute ROI using functions
Recommended Approach:
Step-01: Understand the Requirements of Computation (It includes understanding of the terms
involved)
Step-02: Design independent functions for computing various related factors (Validate the Results
and then Proceed)
Step-03: Cascade the dependent function and return valid result of computation
Step-04: Demonstrate reusability aspect or modularity in doing computation HINT: Refer to
Problem Statement_04
Step-05: Making computation more efficient and practical to implement (eg-Visitors who
purchased the products canâ€™t be greater than site visitors ).
